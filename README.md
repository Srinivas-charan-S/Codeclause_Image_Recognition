CNN Image Classifier
This project implements an image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow, trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Introduction
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models most commonly used for analyzing visual data. This project demonstrates the application of CNNs to classify images into predefined categories using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Normalize pixel values of images to improve the efficiency and performance of the training process.
Model Architecture: The CNN model is designed with several layers, including convolutional layers, activation layers (ReLU), pooling layers, and dense (fully connected) layers to learn and classify image features.
Training and Evaluation: The model is trained using the CIFAR-10 dataset, with performance evaluated on a separate test set to ensure the model generalizes well to new data.
Image Prediction: After training, the model can predict the class of new, unseen images, providing a confidence score for each class.
Installation
Clone the Repository: Obtain the project files from the repository.
Set Up Environment: Install the necessary dependencies as listed in the project's requirements file.
Usage
Training the Model
Train the Model: Use the training script to train the CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This involves feeding the model with training images and their corresponding labels, adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the loss.
Predicting New Images
Predict Image Class: Use the prediction script to classify new images. The trained model processes the input image and outputs the predicted class along with confidence scores for each possible class.
Results
Model Performance: After training, the model's performance is evaluated on a test dataset, with metrics such as accuracy reported. The model is expected to achieve high accuracy in classifying images into the correct categories.
